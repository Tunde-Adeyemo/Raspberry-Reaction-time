# Raspberry-Reaction-time
Using a Raspberry-Pi to create a circuit that can read out the time taken to hit a switch
We make 2 examples with different layouts each capable of comparing reaction times of different participants
with the  intention of creating a competetive game in which participants can compare their results.
